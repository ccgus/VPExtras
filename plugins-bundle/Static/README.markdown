# Static, a static weblog generator for VoodooPad

Right now, this guy isn't exactly ready from primetime use.  And it also exposes a bunch of private APIs in VoodooPad that Gus is working to try and make public versions for.

But if you want to play, read on.

## Requirements:
Static requires VoodooPad 5.1 or later.

## Installing:
Static ships with VoodooPad 5.1, so you've probably already got it.  If you're wanting to test out some changes you've made, 
Drag and drop Static.vpplugin onto VoodooPad 5, and it will offer to install it into your plugins directory.  Relaunch VoodooPad, and it will show up in the palettes list.

## Usage:
***Note:** you should play with this on a brand new document.*

Choose the "Open Help Page" menu item from the action menu in the Static palette.  Follow the instructions.

## Scriptlets:
You can use scriptlets in your posts and templates!  You can read about VoodooPad's scriptlet support here: http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/docs-5/scriptlets.html
