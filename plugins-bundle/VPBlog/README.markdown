# VPBlog, a static weblog generator for VoodooPad

Right now, this guy isn't exactly ready from primetime use.  And it also exposes a bunch of private APIs in VoodooPad that Gus is working to try and make public versions for.

But if you want to play, read on.

## Requirements:
VPBlog requires VoodooPad 5.0.1 or later.

## Installing:
Drag and drop VPBlog.vpplugin onto VoodooPad 5, and it will offer to install it into your plugins directory.  Relaunch VoodooPad, and it will show up in the palettes list.

## Usage:
***Note:** you should play with this on a brand new document.*

Choose the "Open Help Page" menu item from the action menu in the VPBlog palette.  Follow the instructions.

## Scriptlets:
You can use scriptlets in your posts and templates!  You can read about VoodooPad's scriptlet support here: http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/docs-5/scriptlets.html
